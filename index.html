            <h2> Biography </h2>
            <p class=""> I was born in 1989 in Cracow, Poland and I have been living and working there ever since.

                I graduated Graphics at Academy of Fine Arts in Cracow in 2011 with Bachelor's Degree.
                Two years later I received Master's Degree in Industrial Design there. </p>

                <p>In 2012 I was recognized with the Rector's scholarship for the Top Students.
                In 2013 I won the Main Prize for the Best Design Diploma in Poland.

                I also took part in the diploma exhibition in the Art Palace in Cracow and Polish Design Focus
                at DMY International Design Festival in Berlin.

                For the last few years I have been successfully working as a designer in IT and other fields. </p>
                <p>

                My artwork stands in opposition to the design process and digital world. I am trying to create untouchable space
                using language reserved only for paint.
                My work is a tribute for the act of creation, the idea of the paintings comes from shapes which are gradually appearing on the canvas.
                I am trying to grasp the story of looseness and complicity of surrounding chaos impossible to be told in any other way. </p>
